# Learning generalist behaviour for traversing different terrains
This repository contains the implementation for the research paper titled "Learning generalist behaviour for traversing different terrain". The paper addresses the limited understanding of robustness and generalisability in neuro-evolutionary methods, specifically focusing on artificial neural networks (ANNs) used in control tasks, such as those applied in robotics.

# Running Experiments and Simulations
1. The project uses the "BipedalWalker-v3" environment of the Gymnasium library, a continuation of the Gym library created for __Reinforcement Learning__ by OpenAI.
   To use the library you will need to run:

  `pip install gymnasium swig gymnasium[box2d]`

  Also, the other libraries used in the experiments can be installed using:

  `pip install numpy evotorch pytorch pandas time keyboard`

   Alternatively, you could install the packages using the requirements.txt file
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
2. Run an experiments using the XNES_BipedalWalker.py files

3. Run the visualisation of the results using the visualise_biped.py file.

# Test if dependencies work
To test if the dependencies work to then run the experiments, you can run the visualise_biped.py file, since it uses all the libraries needed for the experiments to run. If the code runs without any problem, you are ready to run all the experiments.

# Code & Files Overview
1. The biped_terrain.py file contains the code for running the BipedalWalker simulation, including the terrain generation. It also includes a heuristic that enables the agent to walk. This heuristic works fine in easy flat terrains but fails in harder terrains generated by the addition functionality.
2. The network.py file contains the PyTorch Neural Network module and Network architecture and some helper functions to parameterize the network with custom weights (same functions used by the Neuroevolution Problem class of evotorch.
3. The XNES_BipedalWalker.py file contains the EVO class which runs the basic evolution experiment of this project.
4. The biped_exp.json file contains all the initial parameters for the experiments such as the population size, generations and network structure.
