# Scope
This repository contains my progress and attempts for the project with the title "*Evolving Generalist Controllers for Variant Terrain Layouts*" (title work in progress).

# Library
The project uses the "BipedalWalker-v3" environment of the Gymnasium library, a continuation of the Gym library created for __Reinforcement Learning__ by OpenAI.
To use the library you will need to run:
`pip install gymnasium`

## Possible Extra Libraries
The BipedalWalker requires the Box2D environment to run. So you might need to additionally run this dependency:
`pip install gymnasium[box2d]`
